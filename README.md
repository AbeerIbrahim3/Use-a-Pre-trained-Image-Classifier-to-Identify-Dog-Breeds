# Use-a-Pre-trained-Image-Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-Breeds
### project objectives:
- Distinguishing between images featuring dogs and those that do not
* Classifying the breeds of dogs present in the identified images
+ Evaluating which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG16) best fulfills the first two objectives.

The project aligns with the criteria specified in the 'Results Table', revealing that:

The VGG model emerged as the superior CNN Architecture, achieving a flawless 100% accuracy in classifying images as "dogs" or "not-a-dog" and demonstrating the highest performance in accurately identifying dog breeds, also with 100% accuracy.
